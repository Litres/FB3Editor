/**
 * The AbstractPlugin class is the base class from which user-implemented plugins should inherit.
 *
 * This class defines the essential API of plugins as used by Components by defining the following methods:
 *
 *   - `init` : The plugin initialization method which the owning Component calls at Component initialization time.
 *
 *     The Component passes itself as the sole parameter.
 *
 *     Subclasses should set up bidirectional links between the plugin and its client Component here.
 *
 *   - `destroy` : The plugin cleanup method which the owning Component calls at Component destruction time.
 *
 *     Use this method to break links between the plugin and the Component and to free any allocated resources.
 *
 *   - `enable` : The base implementation just sets the plugin's `disabled` flag to `false`
 *
 *   - `disable` : The base implementation just sets the plugin's `disabled` flag to `true`
