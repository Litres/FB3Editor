/**
 * This plugin provides drag and drop functionality for a {@link Ext.grid.View GridView}.
 *
 * A specialized instance of {@link Ext.dd.DragZone DragZone} and {@link Ext.dd.DropZone 
 * DropZone} are attached to the grid view.  The DropZone will participate in drops 
 * from DragZones having the same {@link #ddGroup} including drops from within the same 
 * grid.
 * 
 * During the drop operation a data object is passed to a participating DropZone's drop 
 * handlers.  The drag data object has the following properties:
 *
 * - **copy:** {@link Boolean} <br> The value of {@link #copy}.  Or `true` if 
 * {@link #allowCopy} is true **and** the control key was pressed as the drag operation 
 * began.
 * 
 * - **view:** {@link Ext.grid.View GridView} <br> The source grid view from which the 
 * drag originated
 * 
 * - **ddel:** HTMLElement <br> The drag proxy element which moves with the cursor
 * 
 * - **item:** HTMLElement <br> The grid view node upon which the mousedown event was 
 * registered
 * 
 * - **records:** {@link Array} <br> An Array of {@link Ext.data.Model Model}s 
 * representing the selected data being dragged from the source grid view
 *
 * By adding this plugin to a view, two new events will be fired from the client 
 * grid view as well as its owning Grid: `{@link #beforedrop}` and `{@link #drop}`.
 *
 *     @example
 *     var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {
 *         fields: ['name'],
 *         data: [
 *             ["Lisa"],
 *             ["Bart"],
 *             ["Homer"],
 *             ["Marge"]
 *         ],
 *         proxy: {
 *             type: 'memory',
 *             reader: 'array'
 *         }
 *     });
 *     
 *     Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {
 *         store: store,
 *         enableLocking: true,
 *         columns: [{
 *             header: 'Name',
 *             dataIndex: 'name',
 *             flex: true
 *         }],
 *         viewConfig: {
 *             plugins: {
 *                 ptype: 'gridviewdragdrop',
 *                 dragText: 'Drag and drop to reorganize'
 *             }
 *         },
 *         height: 200,
 *         width: 400,
 *         renderTo: Ext.getBody()
 *     });

    /**
     * @event beforedrop
     * **This event is fired through the {@link Ext.grid.View GridView} and its owning 
     * {@link Ext.grid.Panel Grid}. You can add listeners to the grid or grid {@link 
     * Ext.grid.Panel#viewConfig view config} object**
     *
     * Fired when a drop gesture has been triggered by a mouseup event in a valid drop 
     * position in the grid view.
     * 
     * Returning `false` to this event signals that the drop gesture was invalid and 
     * animates the drag proxy back to the point from which the drag began.
     * 
     * The dropHandlers parameter can be used to defer the processing of this event. For 
     * example, you can force the handler to wait for the result of a message box 
     * confirmation or an asynchronous server call (_see the details of the dropHandlers 
     * property for more information_).
     *  
     *     grid.on('beforedrop', function(node, data, overModel, dropPosition, dropHandlers) {
     *         // Defer the handling
     *         dropHandlers.wait = true;
     *         Ext.MessageBox.confirm('Drop', 'Are you sure', function(btn){
     *             if (btn === 'yes') {
     *                 dropHandlers.processDrop();
     *             } else {
     *                 dropHandlers.cancelDrop();
     *             }
     *         });
     *     });
     * 
     * Any other return value continues with the data transfer operation unless the wait 
     * property is set.
     *
     * @param {HTMLElement} node The {@link Ext.grid.View grid view} node **if any** over 
     * which the cursor was positioned.
     *
     * @param {Object} data The data object gathered at mousedown time by the 
     * cooperating {@link Ext.dd.DragZone DragZone}'s {@link Ext.dd.DragZone#getDragData 
     * getDragData} method.  It contains the following properties:
     * @param {Boolean} data.copy The value of {@link #copy}.  Or `true` if 
     * {@link #allowCopy} is true **and** the control key was pressed as the drag 
     * operation began.
     * @param {Ext.grid.View} data.view The source grid view from which the drag 
     * originated
     * @param {HTMLElement} data.ddel The drag proxy element which moves with the cursor
     * @param {HTMLElement} data.item The grid view node upon which the mousedown event 
     * was registered

     * selected data being dragged from the source grid view
     *
     * @param {Ext.data.Model} overModel The Model over which the drop gesture took place
     *
     * @param {String} dropPosition `"before"` or `"after"` depending on whether the 
     * cursor is above or below the mid-line of the node.
     *
     * @param {Object} dropHandlers
     * This parameter allows the developer to control when the drop action takes place. 
     * It is useful if any asynchronous processing needs to be completed before 
     * performing the drop. This object has the following properties:
     * 
     * @param {Boolean} dropHandlers.wait Indicates whether the drop should be deferred. 
     * Set this property to true to defer the drop.
     * @param {Function} dropHandlers.processDrop A function to be called to complete 
     * the drop operation.
     * @param {Function} dropHandlers.cancelDrop A function to be called to cancel the 
     * drop operation.
