/**
 * This plugin provides drag and drop functionality for a {@link Ext.tree.View TreeView}.
 * 
 * A specialized instance of {@link Ext.dd.DragZone DragZone} and {@link Ext.dd.DropZone 
 * DropZone} are attached to the tree view.  The DropZone will participate in drops 
 * from DragZones having the same {@link #ddGroup} including drops from within the same 
 * tree.
 * 
 * During the drop operation a data object is passed to a participating DropZone's drop 
 * handlers.  The drag data object has the following properties:
 *
 * - **copy:** {@link Boolean} <br> The value of {@link #copy}.  Or `true` if {@link 
 * #allowCopy} is true **and** the control key was pressed as the drag operation began.
 * 
 * - **view:** {@link Ext.tree.View TreeView} <br> The source tree view from which the 
 * drag originated
 * 
 * - **ddel:** HTMLElement <br> The drag proxy element which moves with the cursor
 * 
 * - **item:** HTMLElement <br> The tree view node upon which the mousedown event was 
 * registered
 * 
 * - **records:** {@link Array} <br> An Array of {@link Ext.data.Model Model}s 
 * representing the selected data being dragged from the source tree view.
 *
 * By adding this plugin to a view, two new events will be fired from the client 
 * tree view as well as its owning Tree: `{@link #beforedrop}` and `{@link #drop}`.

     * @event beforedrop
     * **This event is fired through the {@link Ext.tree.View TreeView} and its owning 
     * {@link Ext.tree.Panel Tree}. You can add listeners to the tree or tree {@link 
     * Ext.tree.Panel#viewConfig view config} object**

     * Fired when a drop gesture has been triggered by a mouseup event in a valid drop 
     * position in the tree view.
     * 
     * Returning `false` to this event signals that the drop gesture was invalid and 
     * animates the drag proxy back to the point from which the drag began.
     * 
     * The dropHandlers parameter can be used to defer the processing of this event. For 
     * example, you can force the handler to wait for the result of a message box 
     * confirmation or an asynchronous server call (_see the details of the dropHandlers 
     * property for more information_).
     *  
     *     tree.on('beforedrop', function(node, data, overModel, dropPosition, dropHandlers) {

     * @param {HTMLElement} node The {@link Ext.tree.View tree view} node **if any** over

     * cursor is above or below the mid-line of the node.
     *
     * @param {Object} dropHandlers
     * This parameter allows the developer to control when the drop action takes place. 
     * It is useful if any asynchronous processing needs to be completed before 
     * performing the drop. This object has the following properties:
     * 
     * @param {Boolean} dropHandlers.wait Indicates whether the drop should be deferred. 
     * Set this property to true to defer the drop.
     * @param {Function} dropHandlers.processDrop A function to be called to complete 
     * the drop operation.
