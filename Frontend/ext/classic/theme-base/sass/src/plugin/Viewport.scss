    // support pointer events.  Without it, a pointercancel event will fire as soon as the
    // touch is moved, and so pointermove will never fire while dragging a finger across
    // the screen.  This also prevents overflowing containers from scrolling using touch
    // and so we must enable "partial" touch scrolling in IE10+ (see Ext.supports.touchScroll)
