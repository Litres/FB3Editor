/**
 * In-memory proxy. This proxy simply uses a local variable for data storage/retrieval, so its contents are lost on
 * every page refresh.
 *
 * Usually this Proxy isn't used directly, serving instead as a helper to a {@link Ext.data.Store Store} where a reader
 * is required to load data. For example, say we have a Store for a User model and have some inline data we want to
 * load, but this data isn't in quite the right format: we can use a MemoryProxy with a JsonReader to read it into our
 * Store:
 *
 *     //this is the model we will be using in the store
 *     Ext.define('User', {
 *         extend: 'Ext.data.Model',
 *         fields: [
 *             {name: 'id',    type: 'int'},
 *             {name: 'name',  type: 'string'},
 *             {name: 'phone', type: 'string', mapping: 'phoneNumber'}
 *         ]
 *     });
 *
 *     //this data does not line up to our model fields - the phone field is called phoneNumber
 *     var data = {
 *         users: [
 *             {
 *                 id: 1,
 *                 name: 'Ed Spencer',
 *                 phoneNumber: '555 1234'
 *             },
 *             {
 *                 id: 2,
 *                 name: 'Abe Elias',
 *                 phoneNumber: '666 1234'
 *             }
 *         ]
 *     };
 *
 *     //note how we set the 'root' in the reader to match the data structure above
 *     var store = Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {
 *         autoLoad: true,
