/**
 * Consequences are used internally by a Deferred to capture and notify callbacks, and
 * propagate their transformed results as fulfillment or rejection.
 *
 * Developers never directly interact with a Consequence.
 *
 * A Consequence forms a chain between two Deferreds, where the result of the first
 * Deferred is transformed by the corresponding callback before being applied to the
 * second Deferred.
 *
 * Each time a Deferred's `then` method is called, it creates a new Consequence that will
 * be triggered once its originating Deferred has been fulfilled or rejected. A Consequence
 * captures a pair of optional onFulfilled and onRejected callbacks.
 *
 * Each Consequence has its own Deferred (which in turn has a Promise) that is resolved or
 * rejected when the Consequence is triggered. When a Consequence is triggered by its
 * originating Deferred, it calls the corresponding callback and propagates the transformed
 * result to its own Deferred; resolved with the callback return value or rejected with any
 * error thrown by the callback.
